# LearningTracker
A simple list to keep track of learning resources - Chrome Extension

This is a simple chrome extension which I use to keep the links of resources to learn...
Normally I would junk up my OperaGX tabs for these resources but now this helps me a lot

I have added all the files for this extension, make sure to take a look!!
